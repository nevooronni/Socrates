SECRET QUESTION:secrets are problems which have an answer, but nobody has figured it out yet.But every great company and product solves a problem for the customer in a new way, previously unknown.what is the fundamental problem trying to solve or build a solution for? tax filing how is it unknown? the fundamental problem is well know and there are current market solution huduma center(pysichal locations) or itax which are all government run monopoly.The main problem is actaully the effeciency of the system since it is done a couple of times for companies which takes up great amout of time and reasources which nobody has been able to solve.This requires automation seamles intergration to both the itax system and the companies and individuals tax filing program or bank acounts/transactional accounts notifications and database with data mining and  data analysis capability that will ultimately make it easier for your customer/end user corporations/small businesses/individuals and the government(benefit is to increase tax revenue and cashflow).what is the pain level? cost and time it takes to file returns for the average individual,business,corporation? fully know 1 month from now.


TIMING QUESTION:
entering new market or existing one(esisting one only competition is the government as far as I'm concerned)what are the suggestions to solve the itax and huguma center problems defeciencies?date deadline? JUNE 30TH 2017 infrastructure readiness?mobile good,internet good,tablets or destktops at corporations even cybers good. Social norms? good want a solution even if they do not know it.Government regulation? very risky find out. Established platforms and ecosystem? silicon savannah talent and financing government is IT savvy and they already have their platform so all is need is an API.The whole gist is to outsource the input of data and documentation evidence and make in non recursive.Start by making it for high networth individuals and corporations then move to small and medium sized businesses and upper/middle income individuals then to lower income and small businesses.
IOT.

.Idea risk: 1.how well does the current system work/performance 2.Pain threshold 30th June 3.Can you actually collaborate with the government to get the API(the idea is hugely exposed to this part of the plan going well).
.Technology risk
.Competiton risk(uhasibu provides similar service with payroll and tax intergration but for VAT don't know if they provide other form of taxing have to test/edge is going to provide full kra intergration before they do taxation is the main problem ours solves not accounting there are many accounting solutions out there for payrolla and financial statements record keeping.)
.Timing risk
.Founders risk- 
.Financing risk
.product risk
.Distribution risk: patnering with banks to distribut the product to moniter financials easier busines financial product for banks to moniter the sales of small business better.
.Market risk
.Hiring risk  
.Location risk

                                                        REPEAT NEXT STEP
start peeling them one by one in a logical order.Always be aware of what you are up against and be honest about it so you can mitigate and survive the risks so you have a chance to prosper in the future.

ELON MUSKS PRINCIPLES FOR PROBLEM SOLVING EXECUTION

1.Focus on the problems and not the tools
2.Use first principles thinking to increase effeciency and come up with new idea.
3.Have a very fast feedback loop testing your ideas quickly using the data to pivote and evolve.
4.Focus on signal over noise: is what you are doing useful to your customers or neccessary in achieving above goals or are you doing what everyone else is doing if so stop those efforts immediately.
5.Always understand the risks you are taking and prepare contigency plans to mitigate them.
