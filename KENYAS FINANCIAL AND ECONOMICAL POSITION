2.ECONOMY
overview cia world fact book

kenya is actaully a lower middle income country not middle income trajectory is threaten by corruption and weak governance unemployment and under employment is atleast 40% of the population explains what happened in the 2007 rigged elections and utleast 60% among the youth real numbers are difficult to find though.Population is roughly 42million.

-Agriculture continues to be the backbone of the economy contributing one-third of the gdp about -80% of the population works in agriculture atleast part-time. 
-75% of output from small scale farmers rain fed farming or livestock production.
-Infrascture can't meet the needed capacity to push the economy to the 8-10% range so it can meaningfully address poverty and unemployment.
-Ifrastrucuture development is funded externally(chinese).
-The IMF and world bank and donores remain important for future economic dev but have raised capital in global markets
-There is undergoing develution of revenue and responsibilities to the counties.
-Always under threat of inflation and sharp currency depreciation.
-Central bank routinely interviews to prop up the currency.
-Global food prices and oil prices when low help mitigate this problem.
-Chronic budget deficits hamper the government to implement development programs(excessive taxes and foreign borrowing instead of liberating the markets to make them more free.)
-FDI is moving in the right direction.(election year to have gone down but expect to bounce back)
-foreign exchange reserves are going back in balance.(2016)ecpect this to have changed but to bounce back after governmetn interest rate pressure picks up
-High inflation(2017 may strong dollar,poor rains,statism sells reserves possibly,socialism) -cap interest rates(lower lending to end possibly somewhere in the next 5years.)
-Tourism holds a significant place in economy(threatened by terrorism)

consult CIA world fact book no need for repetition.(better data pivoting)


you wiil gauge which are needed immediately and which intermediary and others long term projects

3.FUTURE GROWTH(Note all very capital intensive sectors)
-Agriculture
-Industry
-Infrasrtucuture
-Real estate
-Transporation
-Communications
-Education
4.POTENTIAL AREAS FOR COMMERCIALISATION

PRODUCTION OF GOODS AND SERVICES(you prefer frontier technologies from 1st world countries to leapfrog old existing technologies that were to be implemented in 3rd world countries to acceleration their evolution mpesa cliche but it is a good idea) ofcourse question here is are there people out there solving these problems are offering good solutions if not can you offer solutions and provide the best one and capture the value while providing it.


-Energy gethermal energy,hydro electric, solar power maybe nuclear(not a lot of innovation super expensive)
-infrastructure level-light rail around nairobi/subway, free ways/double decker highways?, cheaper roads,private ports and airports.
-industry-steel or iron manufactering, car productionm/assembly,refineries,machineries and transport equipment
-Constrcution of commercial and affordable housing projects
-Transportation.
-Media(new forms of radio internet penetration will incentivize demand for new forms of media e.g youtube next 10years)
-Internet(leapfrogging opportunities)
-data science and ML/AI(leapfrogging)
-Financial engineering using tech not finance(leapfrogging that accelerates adoption of developed world modern societies)
-Education that produces 10x results

Look at these and decide which is more important in terms of boosting productivity and proving to be the most evolutionary and revolutionary and decide how you are going to check mate the market.
