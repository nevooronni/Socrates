Movies and pop culture get this all wrong. The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous lie. It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't had ours. It prevents people with seeds of good ideas from getting started. Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about innovation? No one writes math formulas on glass. That's not a thing.
you have to have sustainable production and consumption solipsism divorces dissapearance of nuclear families low birthrates less socialised experiences environmental degradation for food and economic growth land and resources we use more resources especially water and fossil fuels and consumption and production of goods and services continues  leading to resource depletion and unsustainability because capitalism creates rich people who consume more and this create a negative feedback loop of resources and hence on consumption and living standards.follow how breakthroughs in efficiencey can be used to chip away scarcities and inefficiencies at industries/sectors/domains so timing is everything(You most of the time have to do it before the actual scarcity arrives if it is done when there is scarcity then usually there is some kind of central authority being the arbiter of who gets to provide the solution have to surprise the marketplace on how to be effective and not just good the importence of the pure)should be out there discovering and learning new things with the excitement of a 5 year old just to have fun

HATE MYSELF BECAUSE I HAD THE SURF INTERNET IDEA BUT THOUGHT IT WAS TOO HARD SO I DID NOT PERSUE FIGURE IT OUT. ARRGH
1.crash course world history
2.automated tax filing system(working on it).(problem of manually filing tax returns and doing double accounting and the pain of using the kra system)
3.Seamlessly intergrated mpesa records(working on it).(someone just enters their id no.)(problem of having to manually record data this may be very incremental)
4.Legal documents auto filing system.(government courts and lawfirms that links their documents preventing people from manually returning documents) 
5.Fully autonomous accounting.(machine learning reminder for invoices and you teach it to write accounts related to 3)(solution to human accounting but this is incremental you have to do better or cobine it with two to make it work)
6.cashless supermarket payment system.(problem is service all of thoe customers simultanously).Like the one amazon did.
7.Data Science/ML/AI for consumer behaviour modelling and prediction for different industries/service sectors(money idea but I do not like it because it means it is a consultancy dependant of human capital which needs to be a legacy business like an accounting firm) government provide security and predict disaster before they happen. impact has to be wide.(firm)(solution to risk management problem)
8.Data analytics for for student behaviour modelling and prediction of future performance looking for aptitide providing free tuition in hopes of returning 10x value to investors.(solution to education price problem)
9.Data analytics for fraud detection this can be embedded in the mpesa model or just used on it's own to detect fraud in corporations and business or by picking better employees.(solution for mpesa fraud detection)
9.ML algorithim that predicts and beats the market to the punch quantitive analysis/(solution to the problem of investing)
10.BRIDGE THAT CONNECTS TO OPERATING SYSTEMS ON A HARD DRIVE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REBOOT AGAIN EVERYTIME YOU WANT TO ACCESS THE OTHER OS(write an os that interchangeably can intergrate both seamlesssy don't know if the computing power would be enough)(solution to OS switching problem)
11.credt rating ML algorithm for predicting acturial bankruptcy.(solution to humans computing asset and personal networths and credit rating)
12.Inventory management application using data analytics(cut's cost and wastage by a factor of 10x and can be used for any wholesale goods).automate the human capital element needed in inventory management(see if you can build the project on time.)(solution to poeple managing their own inventory)
12.Data analytics and machine learnig with a web and mobile app platform to do insuarance appraisals(enterprise software company or a new type of insuarance company).
(solution to people appraising insuarance manually frees up human capital to do other work)

strike/attack where they are least prepared appear were the enemy least expects it, to be invinsible to your enemy is the objective constantly wondering never sure what you will do next you must be patient and agile here then deploy theatrics and deception which are powerful agents to the unititiated. To do this you have to face your fears and not get burried in them with guilt or anger then you transcend to the ideal and become more than man there you can face hundreds instead of one. For the most important step to do all of this you must mind your surroundings and transcend above everything else and see,listen,hear,smell,touch,taste, you must become more than a man in the mind of your opponent.Remember the most important rule of all training,skill,intelligent,status,beauty,talent,money,power,priviledge is nothing will is everything the will to act.To conquer fear you must become fear bask in the fear of other mean and men fear most what they cannot see whar they do not understand.Feel fear power to distort your senses to control and know this power can become yours you have to become an idea a wraith someting your followers strive for and your enemies are terrified of.Embrace your worst fear become one with the darkness as you tremble in the dark focus concentrate come to your senses master your senses and you will prevail and achieve true enlightenment.Seek mostly that which stimulates your senses both pain and pleasure and seek to understand why it is so.So the masses need dramatic actions to shake them out of apathy can't do that as a man but as a symbol and ideal you cannot be destroyed, killed or smouthered with excess power.As a man you can be ignored you can be destroyed but as a symbol you can become something elemental incorruptible and terryfying.It is not who you are underneath that defines you it is what you do.I am not talented I am obsessed.lower intelligence actually makes people happy because ignorance is bliss no on e is hated than he who speaks the truth "plato" and do not the classic smart person mistake of thinking there is not someboy else smarter than you.I am Happiest Alone. People are incredibly stupid and shallow. I'm happy in my own little world and I'm NOT Lonely.ï»¿HAPINESS IN INTELLIGENT PEOPLE IS THE RAREST THINGS IN LIFE IT'S NOT OPPOSITIES DO NOT ATTRACT IT IS SIMILARITIES THAT BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.The best way to predict the future is to build it.on how to be effective and not just good the note the importence of the pure e.g jesus christ and how every religous leader since him has gotten more powerful on the vestige of his slave morality yet here they are as princes and kings in their domains preaching about humility and submission.You can be good without being meek stop these perverse counter productive obssession of yours with slave morality.Should learn from the slickest and most devious operators around the world how to scare and intimidate,cajole and bully, entrap and beguile. We are all ultimately the sum of what we achieve not what we intend.If we care about wisdom,kindness,seriousness and virtue but only ever act wisely,kindly,seriously, and virtously,we will, get nowthere or progress will be extremely slow just look how long it took the world to accept the idead of democracy it took thousand plus years of tyranny for people to finally say we have had enough.People need learn lessons from an unexpected source: those we temperamentally most depise.(give them a show of their lives).They have the most to teach us about how to bring the reality we yearn for but that they are fighting against.We should care more about being effective rather than nobly intentioned but when strive for both is can be a powerful weapon it's now enought to dream well the true measure is what we achieve.The purpose is to change the world for the better not reside in the quiet comforts of good intentions and a warm heart.We tell ourselves we didn't get there because we're a little too pure,good and kind but we are stuck becuase we have been too short sighted to learn from those who really know: our enemies.at the end of the day it is how bad do you want it do be the best you have to work overtime.
we are faking experiences by sharing to feel that we are alive that feeling all connected is going to make us feel less alone but the opposite is true we are just going to feel more alone superficial aesthetic consumerist status based world we live in based on quantity and not quality value things on what level you can acomplish them and what quality they come with and not based on appearances and reputation alone.nobody is dreaming about tommorrow they can't wait for it that is what your ideas should inspire they should want it so bad they can't wait to wake up.That need to do the unexpected and know the unknown is powerful it will inspire generations to follow but it has to be accomplished first.How bad do you want it.Have you stopped dreaming.when the distracting spectacles are over and history is written what are they going to say.Remeber that the forces of tyranny and social catastrophe govern our world others trying to impose their will on others whether good or bad the gist of the story is to understand what is important and they use all our will to accomplish it While the rest focus on keeping up appearances you work like a poor man to make the unknown known visualize it until you see it happen and then replicate it in the real world.they have to conduct themselves accordingly to attain this future being moral above all else that is what religion is moral truth and even if you do not believe in it's teachings like I do you have to understand why it is important in holding the fabric of society in place and ensure we function giving order inside the chaos it's simplicity appeals to the impoverished less educated downtrodden the world has always been controlled by sociopaths who will do anything to reamain at the top so good ideas sprung out of rebels who think outside the conventional box and form their own insurgency to counter the incumbets who control everything if their idea is appealing relative to what is currently adhered to then it is widely adopted and this is where a shift occurs the once unknown and easily dismissed rebels are now respectable leaders with growing wealth, power and status now they have a lot to loose and once their ideas go mainstream they will either be forced to turn to the tyrants they so detested or someone crazier and bolder than them will come and replace them and become the tyrant now fighting hard to keep things as they are avoid change at all cost eliminating all threats to their rules and squashing new ideas that may one day challenge theirs before they gather steam this is what we are up against literally every day when you wake up and go about the world the cycle of brilliance to tyranny and the social pressures they inflict upon mankind just as ideas evolve so does the tyrant and the brilliant rebels the tyrant of the past will not survive today and so the rebel.The best rebels inspire by willing to risk everything for their ideas including death unshakable faith while the best tyrants inspire loyalty through fear of punishment for challenging their authority.perpetua inspires the guard to convert first their opression inspires rebellion second their power makes them underestimate the threat until it is too late then they over react through excessive force which makes the insurgency even more famous/popular  until there is a runaway chain reaction that cannot be stopped until the idea becomes mainstream matyrs are what creates religions power is what creats tyrants.It is very important to understand where you lie in the dominance hierarchy you lie.To have a stake in certain arenas such as politics and business they are certain prerequisite ideas that need to be embraced.you just have to reach at the edge of production or dominance hierarchies faster so the men at the top do not control you and you actually get to implement some rules of your own
What are the prevalent ideas in your culture? are they for you and your culture's benefit or are they holding you back? What do people accept as possible/normal and impossibel(but is actually not true)remember to follow an ideal you have to put everything on the line.Imagine what you could be and aim single mindedly at that let it be forward looking.Improve our understanding of the universe so we know what are the right questions to ask even if we do not at first.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION(forces(emerging technologies or ideas) that influence progress and change(is it pessimistic or optimistic is it determinate or indeterminate) for the better there are current solutions to current problems/challenges(people have taken responsibility for them highly concentrated) midlevel(full responsibility but haven't solve the problem fully mid level opportunity speed is key)and there are no solutions for current and future problems(no one has claimed responsibility biggest opportunities lie few concetrated will be challenged by the old incumbents)) so what are your expectations and do they much other people's expectatios(are they lower or higher than in the past)is your current location going through a globalisation or technology phase or both and contrast it with the rest of the world.

5 things to enact change

1)Raise your standards(give up on playing small what would you like to see that will make you extremely happy that is being done but is doable if hard work is applied) 
2)Get rid of your limiting beliefs face fears and have the will to act(give up on excuses)
3)Get a plan(short term mindset give up think long term)
4)seek truth over conformity(Give up the need to be liked)
5)seek masters and similar like minded people taking the same journey as you(Avoid toxic people)you are the average of the people you spend most of your time with.


BEHAVIOURAL ANALYTICS

1)Aesthetics
2)Achievements(so here you are looking at opportunity cost)
3)Family
4)Friends(who do you keep in the loop) 
5)Health
6)Curiosity

BAD HABITS
ALL OF THIS IS DUE TO LIVING IN THE MATRIX AND NOT APPLYING YOUR IDEAS WHERE THE INTERSECTION OF THE REAL AND VIRTUAL WORLD EXISTS(Conciousness-meditation what do you want to do before you do it then do it to try not to sleep back in to the matrix focus and collect data).
1)youtube over-indulgunce(cue anticaption,house,ohter houses, day and night, even with other people, internet availablility is immediate action reward-excitement cures anxiety new routine-channels quick zoom and replace with exercise and meditation). Like going into the matrix who the hell is influencing you.
2)Oversleeping(cue-staying up doing nothing routine-oversleep reward-no hardship no pain new routine-start 8 hours then drop to 7hours per day)
3)socialize(friends and family and strangers)(cue timidness seeking validation,home and away,meet people or new people reward-saftey reward new routine-be in control always ascertain their intentions and validate importance before engaging and lead come up with the best idea look at what you are spending time on business,girls,pool,fifa,food,ball,meet new people,bets on football challenges etc make it stimulate your senses)do not settle for less.
4)Procrastination(afternoon movies)(cue-home,anxiety,day and night,alone and other people,internet reward-safety no anxiety new routine-meditation, exercise, build build)
5)Master(cue-home,excitement mind locked in pattern,alone,afternoon and night,offloading or about to begin a huge load just do it for the first 20min reward-A feeling of accomplishment get off no anixety but it soon returns the feeling of guilt new routine-replace it with emotional and mindful engaging activities prefarably with people and they must conform wiht your plans adventure)youtube flirt, exericse, take a walk, meet other people,play a game.

remember you just need one month to establish a pattern and chunk an activity into your brain the old patterns will still exists but they will remain rusty what matters is not who you are inside but what you do so it doesn't matter that you think it don't do it will be painful at first then harder but focus on yourself transcend.Doubt itself is the mans biggest enemy.


MORINGA SCHOOL
BIGGEST RISK IS DO YOU HAVE THE WILL TO ACT?-Already know I do
1)scheduling risk if I want to do the two courses-june to september september to (not sorted out and also where do most of the people end up in moringa.It is not your typical over40 lecturers and adminstrators)
2)financing risk-moringa prep already sorted moringa core?(halfway)
3)aesthetics risk-(not a factor as much as you think)
4)socializing risk-(boring will to explore)
5)constitency risk(timing early rising and submission)-
6)completion risk(Are you a quiter)-
7)execution risk(job or projects)-

if people agree with what your conclusions and have current solutions in the market place then you are just competing on supply and incremental differences you do not want that you want huge differences and monopoly on supply if not a monopoly then a head start on supply that allows you to capture market share.wishful thinking is innate in human beings and so we want the world to be a certain way the way we want it and so we tend to filter certain information that's why we do not achieve the results that we desire because either we are afraid of failure or when we fail we do not go to the core of why that occured so that we do not repeat it in the future people do not like thinking about their flaws because it just makes them uncomfortable the most common human flaw.
