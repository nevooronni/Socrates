believe that the economies of different countries have worked in essentially the same ways for as far back as you can see so that the most important cause-effect relationships are timeless and universal.

What are the Keys to Success? I Will Start With a Top-Down Perspective:Then get really specific later on.

Productivity Influences on Growth Are Intertwined With Debt Influences: While my objective is to look at
productivity in this section, in doing so I wanted to tie that into looking at the drivers of growth over the next 10
years, which is affected by debt as well as the drivers of productivity. In other words, productivity influences on
growth and debt influences on growth are unavoidably entangled. As explained in “How the Economic Machine
Works,” while productivity growth is ultimately what matters for long-term prosperity, and the effects of debt
cycles cancel out over time, the swings around that productivity long-term trend arising from debt cycles cancel
out over such long amounts of time (upwards of 100 years because of long-term debt cycles) that it is impossible
to look at growth periods without debt cycles playing a role in driving the outcomes. Of course, when one
lengthens the observed timeframe, the shorter-term volatility that is due to debt swings diminishes in
importance. We chose to look at rolling 10-year periods of 20 countries which gave us a sample size of 159
observations (where we measure every 5 years).
The Big Picture: Stepping away from the wiggles of any given day, and looking from the top down, one can see
that the big shifts in economic growth are about two-thirds driven by productivity and one-third driven by
indebtedness. “Luck” (e.g., having a lot of resources when the resources are valuable) and “conflict” (especially
wars) are also drivers.That cost of production arbitrage has been a big driver of
growth—in fact overwhelmingly the largest. To reiterate, the magnitude of this competitiveness arbitrage is
driven more by the cost of the workers relative to how hard they work, their education(specifically the cost of educating them),
 and investment levels(attitudes about work,cost of raw materials, lending and capital market efficiencies and bureacracy & corruption, rule of law.),
than by anything else. These variables characterize the value of hiring a worker in a given country and doing
business there (i.e., what you pay for what you get).While countries that operate efficiently will grow at faster paces than countries 
that operate inefficiently, the countries that will grow the fastest are those that have big inefficiencies that are disposed of(Russia 
but Putin is busy creating a whole generation of deadweight's because he doesn't like the west, if he was half as smart as the media makes
him out to be he would know that markets always win and for him to get his ultimate victory over the west would to be more prosperous than the 
west isn't that why he is mad at the west they are more prosperous than them besides that's how the soviet union fell because they they didn't 
have enough capital muslcle to back up their ambitions and that was because of underdevelopment of markets).It’s intuitive that what a country’s people value and how
they operate together matters for a country’s competitive position. Culture influences the decisions people make
about factors such as savings rates or how many hours they work each week. Culture can also help explain why
a country can appear to have the right ingredients for growth but consistently underperform, or vice versa. For
example, in Russia, which has a lot of untapped potential, the culture that affects lifestyles (e.g., alcoholism, the
low drive to succeed, etc.) causes it to substantially under-live its potential, while in Singapore, where high
income levels make their labor relatively uncompetitive, their lifestyles and values (e.g., around working, saving
and investing) allow them to realize a higher percentage of their potential.1) the extent to which individuals enjoy the rewards and suffer the
penalties of their productivity (i.e., the degrees of their self-sufficiency)Do they believe in individual responsibility(earn their keep not socialist)2) how much the people value savoring
life versus achieving, 3) the extent to which innovation and commercialism are valued, 4) the degree of
bureaucracy, 5) the extent of corruption and 6) the extent to which there is rule of law. Basically, countries that
have people who earn their keep, strive to achieve and innovate, and facilitate an efficient market-based
economy will grow faster than countries that prioritize savoring life, undermine market forces through highly
redistributive systems, and have inefficient institutions.

Indebtedness

When you are taking it out, you can spend more than is sustainable, which will give you the
appearance of being prosperous.That creates cycles.
When debt levels are low relative to income levels and are rising, the upward cycle is self-reinforcing on the
upside because rising spending generates rising incomes and rising net worths, which raise borrowers’ capacity
to borrow, which allows more buying and spending, etc. However, since debts can’t rise faster than money and
income forever, there are limits to debt growth.At such times, you and those who are lending to you might mistake you as
being creditworthy and not pay enough attention to what paying back will look like. When debts can no longer
be raised relative to incomes and the time for paying back comes, the process works in reverse.
ou can get a picture of where countries stand in the long-term debt cycle and the likelihood of debt being a
support or detriment to future growth by assessing the past reliance on debt to support incomes and the
attractiveness of taking on new debt. For these reasons I expect countries that have a) low amounts of debt
relative to incomes, b) debt growth rates that are low in relation to income growth rates and c) easier
monetary policies to grow faster over the next ten years than countries with d) high amounts of debt relative
to incomes, e) debt growth rates that are high in relation to income growth rates and f) tighter monetary
policies. That is true with one exception, which is when adequate financial intermediaries don’t exist.
Institutions and capital markets that facilitate these transactions have to be in place for the system to work. For
that reason, when forecasting long-term future growth rates we have taken into consideration the levels of
development of countries’ financial intermediaries.
Luck and Wars: As mentioned, they can play a role. For example, the US having shale gas was lucky. Potential
conflicts should always be watched. While to some extent these can be anticipated, they are not part of our
formula and they don’t typically matter much—i.e., they are exceptional.
The Interaction of These Forces is Driven By Human Nature

I briefly touched on culture as an influence on these choices and
their outcomes. Also, I observe important shifts in attitudes from one generation to the next which are due to
their different experiences.The key is that this money and credit must be used to
produce investments that yield enough returns to pay for the debt service and finance further growth (so that
incomes rise as fast as or faster than debts).Yet as countries grow wealthier, more and more of the credit tends
to fuel consumption rather than investment. A process that was once virtuous can become self-destructive. The
decreased investment in quality projects means productivity growth slows, even as the borrowing and spending
makes incomes grow and labor more expensive. People feel rich and begin taking more leisure—after all, asset
prices are high—even though their balance sheets are starting to deteriorate. At this point, debt burdens start to
compound and incomes grow faster than productivity growth. In other words, the country tends to become
over-indebted and uncompetitive. The country is becoming poor even though it is still behaving as though it is
rich. Eventually the excess tends to lead to bubbles bursting, a period of slow decline and deleveraging. Suffice it
to say that when looking at a country’s potential to grow, it is critical to look at the country’s productivity and
indebtedness holistically, as part of its stage of development.In the short term debt affects growth but in the long term it
productivity and not debt that will ultimately determine your prosperity.

As discussed, by looking at the elements that drive productivity and indebtedness you can arrive at a view of how
fast a country will grow its output per worker. Since economic growth is mechanically just a function of growth in
its a) output per worker and b) number of workers, it’s then a simple step for us to estimate economic growth
There is also much more
room for these countries to leverage up whereas much of the developed world has reached its long-term debt
top and is deleveraging, which means there is much more limited room for spending and income growth to come
from credit expansion.We expect the producers who are more competitive to
both 1) sell more in their own country and other countries, and 2) move their production to countries where they
can produce more cost-effectively.As explained, the most important way countries differentiate themselves is through their labor: whether it is
more attractive for a company to hire their workers than to hire workers in a different country. This is not just a
function of whether the workers are more productive today. It’s a function of the attributes that make them more
attractive to hire and invest in the long term. Since ultimately the only way one can become more productive is
through working harder or working smarter, it makes intuitive sense to us that education and work ethic are the
most important attributes that matter.

Absent
other indications of productivity or indications of what you get for workers, we’d expect relative income levels
alone to give you some indication of a country’s relative future growth, albeit a naïve one. Through time,
countries with cheap workers and low skills can leverage existing technology to increase their productive ability.
Similarly, the richest countries generally do not continue to outperform the rest of the world, as their competitive
advantages are eaten away by technology transfers to less competitive economies, and the normal behavior of
most economies is to increasingly savor the fruits of success by working and investing less.Politics ultimately is the cause 
of all the decline of empires.Remeber politics actually doesn't solve anything it a dopamine or cortisol stimulant to our primitive
brain which is very addictive, because it is so theoretical and not tested enough yet an overshelmong majority of the population decide
to dedicate significant resourcea and time to it and this too factors increase the more developed a nation gets it is by this that I come to 
my conclusion, this is why it is difficult to hold a competitive edge over other countries for say 150yrs more in peacetime. Military 
conquest has been used to suppliment this throughout human history but as military engagemets become more costly with the invention
of ever deadlier weapons and garauntee of mutual destruction this is no longer an attractive alternative. So you can either dominate
politically or economically political domination in of itself is not sustainable since it need money and that comes from the economy.
So the only way for sustainable prosperity and competitive edge over would be enemies is to be ecomically superior failer to do 
this will lead to deterioration of your edge and overall standing and prosperity around the world.Working hard doesn't just mean working long hours 
it means valuing achievement and quality outcomes and always improving.We expect a country with a hard-working society that is low-cost to be more
 competitive and grow faster than a country with a population that prefers leisure and is expensive.

Savoring Life Versus Achieving Subcomponents: Observed Outcomes
One straightforward way to see whether a society values achieving over leisure is to observe the outcomes of
their choices: literally how much effort they put into work. A society whose people strive hard to achieve in a
market-based system will likely have a more vibrant, competitive business environment. These traits will make it
more likely to improve its potential than an economy which chooses to value the fruits of life instead. Often we
will see countries that have acquired great wealth and become rich begin to make this choice.

if you control the subsistence of a man you control his will very few people will bite the hand that feeds them demagougery appeals for class warfare and race warfare when a governed society decides that voting for life is more profitable than working for life it will not stop until they have picked up every penny from the last producer of society

Rule of Law
A strong rule of law helps ensure fair competition in a market-based system and it protects the incentives and
efficiency of this system.

Again, we won’t
delve into all the reasons here, but it’s intuitive that countries that have less resources and less educated
populations have more immature legal systems

On the basis of productivity and indebtedness alone, the countries which have the elements to grow incomes per
worker fastest today are India, China, Thailand, Singapore and Korea.

Feminism the most misunderstood ideology of the 21st century even the very sex that proudly bears it's flag
classic example is the feather girls in britain shaming men to go to war to kill hitler and his men before they come to britain to do the same to them  here is a bunch of men who take action due to being shamed by a bunch of bitchy women they have never met just so they can qualify themselves to them them being women and society in general  to prove their masculinity for future sex opportunities to pass on their genes the women virtue signaling the alpha males who started the war in the first place and send this sheep like men to do their bidding and face unnecesary suffering and death in war it's amazing how evolution is ruthlessly efficient at rooting out weak males from the gene pool who will not contribute to the dominant males agenda which is presumed to be the most optimal for the group they are leading the alpha males set the standard by reaching far beyong their grasp or going and doing things no man did before them enterprising seeking out power wealth intellect and the females enforcing their standards to the rest in the dominance hierachies it beautiful! natures organised choas

once they realise baing a man is about doing and not feeling being useful in male context and learning male skills to proivde for your kin resorces,security etc in return get to ensure the species continues on and their genes will be part of it. In in a survivalist world where everything is constantly trying to kill you which is where humanity has lived through on the time scale this is absolutely crucial it is no surprise looking back retrospectively why the great explorers,conquerers,kings,priests,revolutionaries,capitalist have been men in this world men have no option but to take what seem like ridicolous risks to weaker men and women but lookin retrospectively now makes sense as they were absolutely necessaty for us to evolve to next level stagnation scarcity and eventual extiction being the other insidious outcome.

comfort and feeling to connect emotionally for women sexually is to have porality for men to connect it's all about bonds forged in competition with other groups(common duty or set or ideals and vision and common status in the dominance hiearachy) and agressive behaviour beating a man to a pulp who threaten his women sexually it is the same. Rwards loyalty and brotherhood females reward conformity/agreeableness and comfort evolution doesn't reward women for competing with men and vice versa men make fun of men who display feminine qualities not because they are sexist but because they see them as men wuth no value to society not useful since can't do manly stuff and not useful because he is not really a woman. An uterus is more valuable than an ejaculation so a man has to do more that is why they identify themselves with their roles
They derive a positive and meaningful identity for performing those meaningful role and this is where women should pay attention because this is the only thing they need to know about men they are that simple men feel the most happiest when they are responsible for a group whether it's their kin,company,country doen't matter they are happiest when they are needed when people depend on them this is why they are do addicted to power and money when they have an important responsibility to perform in their societies which makes them rise up in the dominance hierachies.

Men are devasted when their identity is question that is their usefulness why suicide rates is high among divorced men they feel no longer valued.Marrige is one of those things that men use to define their masculinity as the role of father and husband providing resources and security for his family we now live in a post marriage society though that may be a bit of an exaggeration to some I do not think so alimony, divorce,child castody and most importantly the government have compelety besieged fatherhood and marrige in western civilization not to mention pop culture of dead beat dads and men are idiots the wife is always right. Modern day man especially young men have seen marriage as a symbol for idiot men used by hypergamous women long enough for them to find a higher value guy if they can and then cash out like she's a silicon valley startup investor.

Vulgurity but authority,aggression,competition,ambition,plain speech all of this are discouraged when women are present in order to spare feeling and discomfort outspokeness is replaced by drawing new rules of discourse inguniety with protocol which ensures that this feminized workplaces though tolerable to men and not viable paths to a positive male identitiy.It is no longer a male space and appears to the pyschology of men. The workplace ladder is no longer desirable for men because of the massive restricitons to their masculinity unless you work at spacex where they don't have time for office politics bs your screwed.Any time a massive number of women enter into a field previously dominated by men then it becomes undesirable to enterprising males who are looking for areas to channel the masculine energy.

The disposable male has to find a role that justifies his usefulness to society and makes him valuable this imposed change in behaviour when women enter a field is usually a deal breaker and it is incompertible with masculine energy which is optimized performance.Once women start to demand the environment change to suit them it is over you can bet than in the future males will not be interested in it should be the other way round wonmen adjusting to the environment when you look at history who are the most famous women there is a interesting similarity with all them is that they conquered male domains not by demanding the domains adjust to suit their feminity but by themselves rising to the challenge and adapting which makes them stand out even more from men of similar accomplishments since it is more rare for a woman. 

The question is where are this males retreating to the few males spaces left out there where women easily offended natured and need to seek comfort isn't catered for the internet, MRM, video games,migtow,PAU community, Silicon valley etc where score keeping competition and winning at all cost is still allowed no feelings society didn't work for them so they created one for themselves they are the resistance.Men have always been wiiling to work,fight,bleed and even die so long as they were rewarded for it with women and respect as they climb their hiarachies now even if they don't know it consiously subconciously they know it is gone. This roles no longer provide men with the self respect and respect from others they usually seek and for the apexuals runnings things shaming won't work this time since there is no reward you can shame a man by calling him a coward for not going to war and he will go so long as he thinks he will get medals and be called a hero and be respected in society when a man works his ass off and get nothing in returns the insurgents start to come out of their hidding places

voters are irrational ignorant and incompetent cool rational and educated individuals vote i propose to ban the vote entirely noocracy.Diffused democracy weakens the ability of politicians to scaremonger and use emotional appeals to take power. Smaller states are laboratories for ideas, as are bigger ones. If they become marginalized and then coerced to embrace the policies favored by the people in urban areas, the nation loses valuable resourcefulness, imagination and brainpower.Similarly, a very recent problem that has emerged with the rise of search engine algorithms is the concept of the filter bubble--though it could be argued that the mainstream media has long blown its own filter bubble with ideologically-based news organizations like Fox and CNN or NPR. Search engines attempt to customize searches to their users by using previous search histories to throw up results they think will more interest their users. In many ways, this can be very helpful. In politics, however, it’s resulting in the extremization of the electorate--more and more of whom are getting their information online.If a user regularly googles “Donald Trump speech” and “Mike Huckabee radio show” combined with something like “Obama is a fascist” or “how the left is wrong about everything,” Google will eventually customize their future searches to be heavily right-leaning until the user begins to feel like the information they already agree with is, in fact, the only information there is. This is the filter bubble and, as a result, people become more extreme and more entrenched in their views.This ability for google to be highly customizable and tailored to the indicidual is why I think it is more valuable than apple as a company.

A politician is a fellow who will lay down your life for his country.well it doesn't matter the west is going to pay a huge price for turning their back on their capitalistic roots think about it for a miniute which is the longest running large communist power the soviet union they did what 70years atleast before it imploded the west has more capital and intellect so you would expect great resistance and insurgency we are looking at a timescale of maybe 150years that's enough time for 3 generations to be fully indoctrinated and the old gaurd to die off and sieze being irrelevant point is future of western civilization is at stake and almost nobody realises it everbody bathing in the fruits of their great grandfathers with a severe case of normalcy bias ignorance and myopis to see the impeding future 100-200years is a lot of time to tell people to think about it just easier to google which black guys are the kadashians dating now and leave all this mental toture to elon musk because he is a genius and we are not.Unlike the misrepresented nitchze you should overpower everbody else and get what you want if it is only good for humanity not only for personal gain I don't think that life is meaningless why then do we have this obssessive nature to survive if it meaningless.There is a higher perpose goal to which wea are not percieving yet.

this is why poor people all over the world have this pervese sense to praise themselves for their self sacrifice poverty and weakness worldly virtues that will be rewarded in afterlife. This slave morality is the direct ancestor of the ethical language we use today.This is very dangerous to the people who practise this religion as it shifts our focus away from our present realities  and problems and assumes that once you are born you inherent a static world where you are placed into a cast that's the benign outcome the worst case happens when ambitions people use those who have weak faith in this groups to their world domination project promising riches,jsutice,fiarness,revenge etc if they just follow him in his revolutionary quest.You can rise above this moral truth or objective truth learn from the slave morality and master slave dynamic and seak a higher perception of reality since religion and ethics and historically interpreted we need to reinterpret them from time to time based on circumstances and use first principles preferably cooperation to do what is best to humanity. Do not follow fixed moral truths because your dogma conforms to an eternal truth.You can freely create your own moral virtues and so it becomes fun like art and insightful to who you are as a person dont be an an uber nihilist but an uber mensch create and impose your own moral values using existentialism transcendent of normal uber humanity so you become the pop culture archetype that plays by his own rules and doesn't answer to lowly human ideas of good or bad the superman.but if he is using this philosopy for self serving perposes then he has fallen into another ethical system egotism can't be fully emersed in the philosophy alone because it won't be true freedom for this to occur you need to test multiple ways of living and find what works best for yourself we are all different.Should live as if you would live like that if you had to live again forever so time doesn't go in circles.Artful moral system nitchze created for himself but don't get trapped into thinking it is some kind of objective truth you have to understand other people onjective truths too or else boom but almost everybody get nitchze wrong and the uber mensch too 

there is massive amounts of information out there but judgement is what is lacking which comes from practicality and experience and judgement is knowing what is important and what isn't is it good or bad and knowing the right course of action to take to avoid or profit from the impeding situation in the most effecient way that gets you what you want.This coems from resistance/suffering throught repetitive practice knowing the real complexitities of a particulat task from having done it many times in the past which means you will be able to manuever through all the information overload and focus on only the useful bits you need to complete the task and ignore the rest so that you avoid cognitive dissonance.Do you percieve it as pain or pleasure and why? is your current bias to your benefit or do you need to change it.
