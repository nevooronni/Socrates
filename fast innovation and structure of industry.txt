When it is hard to differentiate yourdelf with others it really is hard when you compete even it makes you better but your identities get us so wrapped up around winning this competitions but it comes at a huge cost and that is what is most important and what truly brings the most value. What is the real objective market and people have real incentives to lie about it. Have asperagers and not easily detered by other people, think of risk in this complicated way, because you are never ready and you will never have enough, don't try to catch the last wave low conviction, no ideas, anti-aspergers,hot head environment you will never do the most important things in life.growth and defensibility running the business speed hardwork proprietary tech  feasibility uniqueness first principles does it make sense or is it what everybody else is doing WHEN JUDGING THE FEASIBILITY OF THE IDEA LOOK AT FIRST PRINCIPLES TO DETERMINE THE PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES DOES IT MAKE SENSE OR ARE WE DOING WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS WHERE IS THE EDGE YOU CAN CORNER THE MARKET ON THEN ON EXECUTION LOOK AT THE RISKS TO CASHFLOW AND (GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY MOAT) FIRST THING YOU LOOK AT IS IT A NEW THING IS THERE AN ABITRAGE OPPORTUNITY SOMEWHERE HOW DO PEOPLE CURRENTLY GO ABOUT ACHIEVING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WHAT ARE THE CURRENT MARKET SOLUTIONS AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS.
