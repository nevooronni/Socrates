low unemplotment rate no slack in the economy credit growth is strong high capacity rising prices for financial assets high employment high profits high credit growth typically occur in 4 phases credit fuels expansion and central banks steps in to raise rates or ease them

expansion phase 1)5 or 6 quarters(1yr 6months) begins with the demand of interest sensitive items cars of houses because of low interest rates lets say savings are high sales of cars,houses and retail start to pick up. Inventory building starts to replace inventory liquidation as people build capacity.Increased demand pulls up the average workweek and emploument up. credit growth is typically fast economic growth is strong(in excess of 4%)but inflation is still low has because production is keeping pace with growth in consumption which is also strong this will happen until
the rate of credit growth exceeds the rate of prodcution/inventory buildup which is easy to do since credit is created out of thin air once people run out of money, the rate of inventory accumulation is increasing the u.s stock market is typically the best investment there is fast growth and rates are low because inflation is still low and inflation hedging assets and commodities are the worst performing assets.

2)mid cycle last average of 3 to 4 quarters(1yr) economic growth slow down sustancially around 2% growth and inflation remains long growth in consumption also slows, the rate of inventory accumulation declines,interest rate continue to dip, the stock market rate of increase tapers off while inflation hedge asset decline slows down.

3)lare cycle 2 1/2 years depending on how much slack existed in the economy in the last recession trough. Economic pace picks up to a moderate pace 3.5-4.5, capacity constraints emerge, but credit demand and growth is still strong , so inflation starts begins to trend higher and growth in consumption rates rises (this is the phase where people are literally being induced to consume), so inventories typically start to pick up again , interest rates rise the stock market stages its last advance and inflation hedge assets become best performing.

4) tihghtening phase actual and anticipated acceleration of inflation prompts the fed to turn restricitive which shows up in reduced liquidity, interest rates rising and the yield curve flattening or inverting causing credit and "money" supply to fall and a stock market decline before the economy turns down(So the fed really for most people control the economy socially engineering mainstreet to be consumer junkie save less and less invest less and less and consume more and more in this short term 5-7year periods until the economy overheats then they encourage them to save and invest to build cashflow for future consumption atleast this is what they used to do today they just lower the rates even further to make it easier for people to service their debt and afford to start consuming agan the very defenition of decadence no where do they stress the importance of productivity and creating value and capturing it (icome) using it so the masses will come to resent those who do this in the future when there are downturns in the economy and they have massive reserves of capital built up during the good days to weather the storm while they are in debt which shrinking networths and incomes).This creates a pop culture based of excessive materialism unsustainable consumption valuing leisure acitivies and dependancey of central authories for prosperity of the nation, a society that values short cuts paternalism over freedom self sufficiency and achievement they start living in the matrix they become slaves to wages and debt because they are promised if you seek this two things you will become prosperous.Using people greatest fear to control them.The fed is constantly reacting to the fears of the market reaction by waking them a realtity and putting them back in the matrix where it is safe.

5)recession phase-1)early part economy contracts, slack returns due to capacity utilization and unmeployment spikes profits dry up stocks go down commodities and inflation hedge assets fall and inflation decline because fed remains tight.

2)phase two central banks ease monetary policy as inflation concerns subside and recession concerns grow so interest rates declines and lower rates cause stock prices to rise even though the economy hasn't yet turne up while commodity prices and inflation hedge assets continue to be weak the lower rates and higher stock prices set the stage for the expansion part of the cycle to begin.

it is the sequence of events that happen (algorithmic) that mattterns not the specific time lines which is important to keep and eye on.

remember to accont for accerating forefulness of the influences which drive progression will account for the rate at which the boom and bursts progress(how fast) and expansiions that came immediately afeter a big recession/depression will last longer than say one will less excess capacity.
also accont for exogenous factors scuh as globalisation chinas entry into the mix wars and natural disasters.

simulation trading programs do not account for the butterfly effct the smallest change can have a huge impact if actions are continously executed based on it's input.They are built with the benefit of hindsight the real world is more likely to have turn out different.

so you either looking at downtrend or a long trend in the long term debt cycle when there is a downtrend like there was a huge develeraging in the 30s during the depression coming of a huge deflation encouraged people to save and reduce debt this meant that every low in interest rates in each cycle was higher than the preseding one and every high in interest rates cycles was higher than the last cycle one.This continued from 0% in 1932 to 19% in 1981 a 50year uptrend for debt interest rates(feds fund rates) then began the downtrend tofrom 19% to 0% in 2009 racked up a lot of debt in the last 30 years like it war time. So here basically the opposite occur every rate low in the cycle is lower than the last one and every rate high is lower than the last one this is to make servicing debt much easier and to allow people to afford to buy goods and services by stimulating credit growth peopl are now encouraged to spend more than they earn and go into debt and don't save and invest for the future.All this does is raises assets prices and individuals networth and everybody feels "rich" but it is actually a mirage people what you really are is in the matrix and whenever the reality of defaulting hits you and wakes you up to take more pills to fall asleep again because reality is more painful you would rather use debt finance consumption to dream away reality horrows.This allows debt levels to climb up very fast but debt service costs relativeto income to stay stable or low and people live beyond their means this conbined with a reserve currency and current account deficit that most of the debt is locally held is a powerful drug that 99% of the population will be addicted to.
