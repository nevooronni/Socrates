                                                                  

                                                                     MPESA RECORD KEEPER(SIMILAR TO A VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM)/ask customere for ID no to confirm no writing this down(what happens when many more businesses accept mpesa payments and payments are online?) Hve to ask yourself very tough questions.Ofcourse we are going to move to a cashless society because of credit and where money can be tracked and correlated to people's proclivities.Fraud detection may be a solution for this using data science.Ask users if they it is burdensom by asking them why they do it is it burdensome.

PETER THIEL'S 7 QUESTIONS FOR PRODUCT INNOVATION

1.ENGINEERING QUESTION(GREAT PRODUCT LUCK) (10x significant advantage automated record keeping and backup and recall if need be) good 
2.TIMING QUESTION(GREAT IDEA GREAT PRODUCT GREAT EXECUTION LUCK) (17.6million active users growth per half year 33.7% to 25.9 billion,mpesa ubiquity close to 100%infrastructure readiness and mpesa ecosystem good alongside social norms potential problem is railroading me.As of August 14th mpesa agents stood at 81k as of dec 2016 it is  287,400)  good but note for saf                                                                            
3.MONOPOLY QUESTION(GREAT PRODUCT GREAT EXECUTION )  (who are your potential competitors? research what ideas have people come up to use on the saf API..Safaricom finding it easier to steal it than buy it then how unique is the product or idea? nobody I can think of yet)                                
4.TALENT QUESTION(GREAT TEAM reputation)  (fullstack developer 1 or 2 and a business/sales guy) good                                           
5.DISTRIBUTION QUESTION(GREAT EXECUTION) (learning curve you will have to market it as saf approved, online support,offlines sales force, safaricom later patnership) good
6.DURABILITY QUESTION(GREAT EXECUTION) (gain momentum by being aggressive in buid up and customer acquisition and testing, scale rapidly prefarably using saf's patnership to build brand loyalty, maintain market share through brand and use cashflows for further innovation this all depends on durability of mpesa platform)good
7.SECRET QESTION(GREAT IDEA) (problem is manual writing and papers solution is fully automated and digital or both.)good note how high is the pain threshold?                                         



ONION THEORY OF RISK(STRATEFY AND EXECUTION BASED OF TIMING, COST AND EMPERICISM ) 

  BUSINESS MODEL STRATEGY(LICENCE)
1.MVP(mpesa api request to send customer data to app then mpesa agent asks withdrawer to state his/her ID no. while they counter check I think we can remove this step too has to be with ID and picture and tracks against know names of criminals in current location and offers tracking requests to officers)
2.PMF 
3.ECONOMIES OF SCALE
4.REPEAT FOR NEXT PRODUCT                               


Logical step to think about the problems to solve not based on importance
.Idea risk: HOW HIGH IS THE PAIN THRESHOLD?      
.Technology risk(anti-money laundering): FULLSTACK DEVELOPER AND A BUSINESS SALES GUY? CAN YOU BUILD THE APP(WEB OR MOBILE OR SHORTCODE USSD)? INTERGRATE IT WITH THE MPESA SYSTEM USING THEIR API? GETTING TO BE ROBUST? PERFORM FLAWLESSLY WITH FEW BUGS AND DOWNTIME? CAN IT BE COST EFFECTIVE?                               
.competition risk(what is the utility delta 10x better than current ): SAFARICOM API IDEAS AND SIMILAR IDEAS IN THE MARKET/UNIQUENESS? SAF APPROPRIATING IT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND AGAINST THAT?
.Timing risk:MPESA API GRANT THIS ACCESS? WILL THEY ALLOW THE PRODUCT IF THEY CONTROL THE DC AND THEY DON'T OWN IT PROBABLY NO SO OFFER THEM A PART OF THE REVENUE?
.Founders risk: FULLSTACK DEVELOPER AND A BUSINESS/SALES GUY PLUS CONNECTION OTHER THAN JUST PROFIT/BOND?
.Product risk: IS IT 10X BASED ON PERFORMANCE? IS IT DONE ON TIME? IS IT COST EFFECTIVE? IS IT USER FRIENDLY?
.Financing risk: DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH HUMAN CAPITAL TO BUILD THE TECHNOLOGY? DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES FOR THE LIVING EXPENSES AND OTHER MISCALLENOUS(SERVER,DOMAIN)? IF NOT HOW DO YOU PLAN ON GETTING IT?  
.Marketing risk:
.Distribution risk:
.Market risk:
.Hiring risk: 
.Location risk:

ELON MUSKS PRINCIPLES FOR PROBLEM SOLVING EXECUTION

1.Focus on the problems and not the tools
2.Use first principles thinking to increase effeciency and come up with new idea.
3.Have a very fast feedback loop testing your ideas quickly using the data to pivote and evolve.
4.Focus on signal over noise: is what you are doing useful to your customers or neccessary in achieving above goals or are you doing what everyone else is doing if so stop those efforts immediately.
5.Always understand the risks you are taking and prepare contigency plans to mitigate them.
